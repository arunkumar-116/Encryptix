# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not, using the Titanic dataset. This dataset is a well-known resource for beginners in data science and machine learning, offering a variety of features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, and cabin information.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following key information about individual passengers:
- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger.
- **Survived**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
- **Name**: Name of the passenger.
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger.
- **Age**: Age of the passenger.
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic.
- **Parch**: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic.
- **Ticket**: Ticket number.
- **Fare**: Passenger fare.
- **Cabin**: Cabin number.
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required packages using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```
# Project Structure
titanic_survival_prediction.py: The main Python file containing the code for loading the dataset, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
## Usage
#Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arunkumar-116/titanic-survival-prediction.git

```
## Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd titanic-survival-prediction
```

## Run the Python script:
```bash
python titanic_survival_prediction.py
```

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing:
- **Handling missing values.**
- **Encoding categorical variables.**
- **Feature scaling.**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

## Visualizing the distribution of features.
Understanding the relationship between features and the target variable (Survived).
Model Building:

## Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Training various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests).
Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Results
The model's performance will be evaluated based on the accuracy and other relevant metrics obtained from the test dataset.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of building a machine learning model to predict survival on the Titanic using a variety of features. It covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## Future Work
Hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
Exploring more advanced models or ensemble techniques.
Deploying the model as a web application.
